        <p>Hi, there! My name is Shulamit.</p>

        <p>
          Let's be honest, it can be hard to be human. It's my belief that we're all just "walking each other home"
          as Ram Dass put it.
        </p>

        <p>
          Do you ever feel like no one really gets it? Like you haven't found your place or your people? Are you wanting
          to not have to try so hard to connect? Wouldn't it be nice to just be with another human and be seen in your fullness?
          I want that for you, too. I've spent the last fifteen or so years walking people home and I'd be honored to walk with you
          for a moment, a season, or longer.
        </p>

        <p>
          I'm informed by multiple relational theories, and even more so, by being a mama. I think we all need skilled attunement
          to see ourselves most clearly. I'm happy to work with you whether we have similar identities or different ones. All parts
          are welcome here.
        </p>

        <p>
          The formal stuff: I'm an Association for Clinical Pastoral Education (ACPE) Certified Educator (2019) and a Board Certified
          Chaplain with the Association of Professional Chaplains (2014). I've worked as a chaplain and as a CPE educator (ie, training chaplains)
          at the Cleveland Clinic (2015-2018) and at the Massachusetts General Hospital (2018-2025), where I directed the CPE program from 2022-2025.
          I have a BA in Religion from Brown University (2007).
        </p>

        <p>
          To be clear, this is spiritual accompaniment, not therapy. We can talk about the religious/spiritual, or not. Really what we focus on
          are connections and disconnections in our lives.
        </p>

        <p>
          I'm also available to talk specifically about chaplaincy training. Do you want help with your CPE application (it's a doozy)?
          Want to do a practice CPE interview? Do you miss CPE supervision and want to go over a case? Let me know, I'm here.
        </p>

        <p>
          Hello, my name is Shao Wei. My mother named me for the blue of the sky and the luxuriant growth of trees (蔚). I was born and grew up in Singapore, and now I live in a place with winter.
        </p>

        <p>
          I write, practise tai chi, and work in a woodshop. I was trained in spiritual care at Massachusetts General Hospital, where I still serve part-time as a Spiritual Care Provider. I studied divinity at Harvard Divinity School (MDiv 2023), psychology at the University of Edinburgh (MSc 2019), and history and literature at Harvard University (AB 2017).
        </p>

        <p>
          If there is anything else you'd like to know about me or my approach, feel free to ask in an email, or when we call.
        </p>
